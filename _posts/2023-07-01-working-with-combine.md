# Working with Combine Framework

In modern iOS development, handling asynchronous tasks efficiently is crucial. While there are several ways to handle asynchronous tasks in Swift, including closures, delegates, and `DispatchQueue`, one powerful approach is to use the Combine framework introduced in iOS 13.

The Combine framework allows you to work with asynchronous events as if they were sequences of values you can transform and manipulate using high-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.

The example code we have been looking at makes extensive use of the Combine framework for network requests. Here's a method that sends a network request and returns a publisher:

```swift
func request<T: Encodable, U: Decodable>(endPoint: APIEndpoint, parameters: T?, authRequired: Bool = true) -> AnyPublisher<U, Error> {
    guard let request = buildRequest(from: endPoint, with: parameters, authRequired: authRequired) else {
        return Fail(error: NetworkError.invalidURL)
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }

    return session.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)
        .tryMap { data, response in
            // handle response here...
            return data
        }
        .decode(type: U.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
        .mapError { error in
            // handle error here...
            return NetworkError.unknownError(error)
        }
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

In this method, a network request is initiated with `session.dataTaskPublisher(for: request)`, which returns a publisher that emits the server's response as a tuple of `(Data, URLResponse)`. 

This is then transformed using `tryMap` to only keep the `Data` part and check the HTTP response status. The resulting data is then decoded into the expected response type `U` with `.decode(type: U.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())`. 

The `mapError` function maps any error that occurs during this process to our custom `NetworkError` type. 

The use of Combine here provides several benefits:

- **Composability**: The publisher returned by the `request` method can be further composed with other publishers to handle complex asynchronous workflows.
- **Error handling**: Errors are propagated along the publisher chain and can be caught and handled at any point.
- **Code readability**: The high-level, declarative syntax of Combine makes the code more readable and easier to understand compared to nested closures or delegate methods.
- **Integration with Swift UI**: Combine works seamlessly with Swift UI, allowing you to easily update your UI based on the results of network requests.

However, as powerful as Combine is, it also has a steep learning curve and may be overkill for simple asynchronous tasks. In those cases, other methods like `async/await` introduced in Swift 5.5 might be more appropriate. It's always important to choose the right tool for the job!
