# Christian Strube - Technology, AI and Life

Welcome! My name is **Christian Strube**. With more than 23 years of experience in the automotive industry, I am a professional Service Advisor and trained Automotive Technician. I currently work at Senger GmbH & Co. KG, where I offer specialized repair services for Mercedes-Benz cars.

My passion lies in the world of technology. I have extensive knowledge in a variety of IT topics and systems, including **Kubernetes, Docker, API development, Python, clustering, Proxmox, Ceph, Linux, and macOS**.

Over the years, I have also developed a particular interest in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and am always keen to deepen my knowledge in this area.

One of my hobbies is iOS development, and I love pushing the boundaries of technology in my homelab. I view each new project as an opportunity to learn more and further develop my skills.

On this website, I share my insights and experiences from both my professional career in the automotive industry and my personal journey through the world of technology and AI.

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. You can find the relevant contact details at the bottom of this page. Thank you for visiting!
